11/21/09,"Notre s√©jour de trois nuits.
Nous avons appr√©cier L'appartement qui est tr√®s bien situ√©. Agr√©able, propre et bien soign√©. C'est id√©al pour une famille de 3 ou 4 personnes.
Petits soucis en arrivant il y avait personne pour nous recevoir, et il manquait le savon pour la douche, le liquide vaisselle, nous les avons re√ßu de surlendemain. Il y a aussi le bruit du M√©tro de NY, donc une premi√®re nuit difficile si on est pas habitu√©. Jennifer est correcte le remboursement de la caution √©tait tr√®s rapide.  A part ces petits d√©tails notre court s√©jour c'est bien pass√©. 
Si j'ai la possibilit√© de revenir sur NY pour les vacances, je reprendrai √† ""The Midtown Castle""

12/5/09,Great experience.
12/10/09,"I've stayed with my friend at the Midtown Castle for six days and it was a lovely place to be. A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.
Attention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!"
4/9/10,"We've been staying here for about 9 nights, enjoying to be in the center of the city, that never sleeps...short ways to everywhere in Manhattan, by subway or by walk. Midtown castle is a beauftiful and tastful place, Jennifer and Tori relaxed and friendly hosts - thats why we - the three Berliners - recommand that place! Good to have WiFi and a little kitchen too!"
5/25/10,We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!
5/7/12,"Hi to everyone!
Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.
The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!"
5/17/12,"Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, and her place is exactly as advertised. The location is very convenient, and it was a pleasure to stay at the Midtown Castle. I definitely recommend it :)

Thanks !"
8/18/12,"This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. 
We weren‚Äôt happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   
After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. 
We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. 
The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are ‚Äúspecial‚Äù adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  
A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! 
"
5/20/13,"Jennifer's place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.  She met us after midnight to give us keys to the place, which we appreciated.

The apartment is spacious for two people; a deli next door is perfect for last minute toiletries.

Thanks for allowing us to stay!"
5/21/14,Jennifer is a very nice host. Everything is clean and she really takes care of her guests. We can only recommend her apartment to others.
7/10/14,"This is a cute studio in a wonderful location with some quirky and interesting traits including a giant translucent skylight (makes the neatest noise when rain falls on it, sounds like clapping!), warm couch, and trinkets that are fun (hoola hoops, juggling pins? sure, why not!?). 

Great place, great location!"
9/28/14,"A great location, a very comfortable space and a helpful host. Everything that makes Airbnb great!"
10/7/14,"Jennifer's place is cozy and a short walking distance from Time Square. The place was big enough for two. 
Jennifer left detailed instructions and was also helpful in terms of recommending great places in NY.

Everything was great:)"
10/18/14,"We hebben genoten van ons verblijf in het appartement van Jennifer. Prima en centraal gelegen, ook t.o.v. openbaar vervoer. Het daklicht maakt dat het prettig licht is en ruim aanvoelt. Enige minpuntje is de vier trappen. "
3/30/15,"Jennifer was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. 

The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!

The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! 

We had a blast! 

Thanks Jennifer! 
"
4/21/15,"I love this space.  It is truly a gem in the heart of Manhattan.  The location could not be better.  Very clean, comfy, and great warm inviting energy.  Jennifer was very clear and responsive."
5/19/15,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Jennifer really made it great! No more hotels for us in the future ;) The communication was friendly and she replied very fast. Just great!!"
9/21/15,"Great location, in the middle of everything. The apartment is well maintained and clean. Jennifer is very responsive to texts/messages. I had a great time there."
9/28/15,"Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!"
4/11/16,"Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.

I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.

Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.

Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us."
7/22/17,"The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip. Jennifer was a great host, and made our self check-in very easy! She gave us all of the information we needed for a smooth trip.  I would highly recommend this place to other visitors, and would consider staying there again when we are back in NYC!"
9/16/17,Tiene una ubicaci√≥n excelente. Buen equipamiento del apartamento. Tal cual se ve en las fotos
10/16/17,"Jennifer is a gracious host with an amazing one of a kind space you won't find anywhere in Mid Manhattan.

The perfect home away from home esp. if you're on business.

Note, the stair climb is LEGIT, not fake news. Jennifer is an excellent communicator with very helpful and clear directions,

The 4 flights of stairs will definitely let you know you're in NYC :)"
10/29/17,"Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.

Quick note: Apartment is located on the 4th floor with no elevator so make sure you don‚Äôt have very heavy luggage. In any case it‚Äôs a good workout :)"
11/4/17,"Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!"
12/3/17,"This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay."
12/10/17,Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment!
12/31/17,"Location Location Location.
Outstanding location near to everything walking, by train or bus.
We enjoy our rent there.

Alonso"
1/1/18,Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.
4/29/18,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jennifer‚Äôs apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. 
The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment"
5/18/18,This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.
5/27/18,The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. 
6/6/18,"Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However 
- the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor
- the building is very old. 
- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. 

However. We do appreciate the stay and the location"
6/29/18,"Jennifer es un anfitri√≥n incre√≠ble. Siempre estuvo comunicada y dej√≥ listos todos los detalles para que mi estancia fuera perfecta. Me sent√≠ como en casa.
El departamento es maravilloso, con mucha luz y una sensaci√≥n de tranquilidad, adem√°s de una ubicaci√≥n inmejorable, justo en el centro de Manhattan!! A unos pasos del Empire State. Totalmente recomendable!!"
9/27/18,"Awesome location, spotless, wonderfully accommodating host. I will definitely stay here next time I am in NYC"
10/1/18,The location made getting to Time Square easily accessible. Apartment was quiet and no disturbances from neighbors at all.
10/8/18,Jennifer‚Äôs place is a wonderful retreat in the middle of the busy city. The bed was super comfy- and the whole space/energy of the place felt very calm and cozy. You can hear some noise in the street (I expected this because you are literally in the heart of the city) but I slept like the proverbial baby every night. Jennifer was kind enough to leave ear plugs in case we needed them but we never did. I definitely recommend her place!
10/21/18,"Great place to stay, very good host"
11/4/18,"Jennifer‚Äôs place is beautiful, cozy and very well located. We were able to walk to every key point of the city from here.  The studio is very clean and spacious.  Thank you for your hospitality. We had an amazing time in NYC!

Best regards,

Lili & Tad"
11/14/18,"Fantastic location, great communication and a really special space. We would definitely stay again."
12/2/18,"Jennifer‚Äôs place was amazing! My husband and I spent a weekend in NYC for our anniversary and it was an absolute blast! Jennifer‚Äôs place is gorgeous and we really felt at home there. We will definitely stay again!

Make sure you like stairs! "
12/16/18,Great space in a fun old building in NYC. Loved the lighting options for the space and the skylight.
1/2/19,"The apartment met expectations to how it was insinuated on the ad. Jennifer is very welcoming and friendly. A little pricey for a <500 sq ft space, but it is a convenient location. If you don't want to walk up a 4 story stair case after an already long day of walking, this place is not for you."
5/7/19,10 / 10 would stay again
5/21/19,Place was so cute and comfy! Host was great and was quick to communicate when I had questions. Quick walk to the subway and only about 5 min walk to the Empire State Building. Overall great stay and host was amazing!
7/14/19,"I'm glad I stayed here. I liked everything.
The apartment is quite spacious and comfortable with an extraordinary glass roof.
A beautiful reflection of the Empire State Building can be seen in the window.
Excellent location in the center of Manhattan, a few minutes walk to the excellent Bryant Park and to the Whole Foods Market.
Jeniffer is very friendly, on the last day when my flight was delayed  she was not against my late check out. I appreciate it."
